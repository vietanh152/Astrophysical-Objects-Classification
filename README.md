## Project Goals üéØ

The primary objective of this project is to develop robust classification models that can accurately distinguish between different types of astrophysical objects based on the data provided by LSST. By utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn, we strive to achieve high classification accuracy and enable automated identification of celestial objects.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.

## Data Source üì°

The observational data used in this project is sourced from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). This dataset contains information about various astrophysical objects observed by the telescope, including their characteristics and properties.

## Models Implemented ü§ñ

### 1. Random Forest Classifier
- Description: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.
- Implementation: We have implemented a Random Forest Classifier using the Scikit-learn library to classify astrophysical objects based on their features.

### 2. Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Description: Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.
- Implementation: We have utilized the Gradient Boosting algorithm to build a robust classification model for astrophysical object identification.

### 3. Neural Network (Keras)
- Description: Neural Networks are a set of algorithms that are inspired by the workings of the human brain. They are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data.
- Implementation: With the help of the Keras library, we have developed a Neural Network model to classify astrophysical objects with high accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics üìä

In assessing the performance of our classification models, we utilize various evaluation metrics, including:

- **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
- **Precision:** Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

## Results üìà

Upon training and evaluating our classification models on the LSST dataset, we have achieved promising results in terms of accuracy and classification performance. The models exhibit the ability to differentiate between different types of astrophysical objects with a high degree of confidence.
